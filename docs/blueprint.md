- Primary color: Deep forest green (#228B22) to evoke nature, growth, and sustainability, aligning with SYMBI0N's focus on regeneration.
- Background color: Very light desaturated green (#F0F8F0) to provide a clean, organic feel without distracting from the content.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#CC6633) to create contrast, representing energy and innovation within the natural context.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short text, providing a modern, tech-forward feel; 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability for longer content.
- Use symbolic icons to represent different services and portfolio highlights. Icons should be clean and related to nature, AI, or urban environments.
- Use a grid-based layout for a structured and clean look. Sections should be clearly defined, and the overall design should promote easy navigation and readability.
- Implement subtle animations on the page, such as parallax scrolling or fade-in effects, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
